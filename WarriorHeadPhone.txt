Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it and will keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

Original issue description:

Design and implement the Warrior Headphone plugin for the Titan7 DAW system.

Feature Overview:

Real-time plugin that enhances the audio output of any headphones—whether plugin-style, cheap consumer, or Bluetooth—to sound like one of the top 3 studio recording headphones in the world (e.g., Sennheiser HD800S, Beyerdynamic DT1990 Pro, Audeze LCD-X).
AI-driven signal processing: frequency response correction, dynamic range improvement, spatial imaging, and clarity enhancement.
Automatic Bluetooth codec compensation for lossy compression.
Ultra-HD, photorealistic UI matching the Titan7 DAW, with selectable studio headphone emulations and A/B audition.
Presets for different genres and monitoring scenarios (tracking, mixing, mastering).
Real-time latency correction for live vocal monitoring on any computer or laptop: eliminates lag so users experience true instantaneous playback, even without a dedicated audio interface.
Seamless integration with DAW’s audio engine and monitoring routing.
Stretch Features:

Automatic detection and profiling of connected headphones.
User option to analyze and match a reference headphone sound from a short sample.
Blend control for original vs. processed sound.
The plugin should be ready for software and future hardware integration.
