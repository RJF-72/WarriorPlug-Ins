Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it and will keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

Original issue description:

Design and implement the Warrior Instrument USB plugin for the Titan7 DAW system.

Feature Overview:

Plugin enables users to record live instruments and microphones directly via a USB strip, eliminating the need for expensive audio interfaces.
Automatically detects the type of instrument or microphone connected via USB.
Applies genre-specific and instrument-appropriate effects (EQ, compression, reverb, amp modeling, etc.) so every recording sounds like it's played by a professional studio musician.
Real-time signal processing optimized for low latency and high fidelity.
Intuitive, photorealistic UI matching the Titan7 DAW, with instrument selection, effect controls, and visual feedback.
Preset and customization options for various instruments and genres.
Seamless integration with DAWâ€™s audio engine and track assignment.
Stretch Features:

Automatic profiling and enhancement for unusual or rare instruments.
Effect chain recommendations based on reference tracks or genre selection.
Live A/B audition and history for undo/redo of effect chains.
The plugin should be ready for both software DAW and future hardware integration.

Fixes #6.
