- eframe/egui for desktop GUI applications
- ALSA system libraries for audio I/O
- X11 and OpenGL for graphics acceleration
- Complex dependency version alignment across workspace

## üìä Plugin Bundle Details

```
target/bundled/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ titan7_mix_master.clap          # CLAP format bundle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ titan7_mix_master.vst3/         # VST3 format bundle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ warrior_headphone.clap          # CLAP format bundle
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ warrior_headphone.vst3/         # VST3 format bundle
```

**Bundle Creation Results**:
- ‚úÖ 4 plugin bundles successfully created
- ‚úÖ Both VST3 and CLAP formats supported
- ‚úÖ Release optimization enabled
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor warnings addressed (unused fields/constants)

## üöß Remaining Development Items

### Plugins Requiring Extended Work
- **warrior_usb**: Partial API modernization (requires comprehensive refactoring)
- **warrior_vocal**: Not yet addressed (similar API modernization needed)

### Development Notes
These plugins use mixed old/new NIH-plug API patterns that require more extensive refactoring than the time investment allowed for this session. They represent good candidates for future development sprints.

## üèÜ Success Metrics

- **Compilation Success**: 3/5 components fully operational
- **Bundle Creation**: 100% success rate for completed plugins
- **Distribution Ready**: 2 professional-grade plugins with dual format support
- **Code Quality**: Modern API patterns established for future development
- **System Integration**: Complete development environment operational
