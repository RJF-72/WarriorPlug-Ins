Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it and will keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

Original issue description:

Design and implement the Warrior Vocal Repair plugin for the Titan7 DAW system.

Feature Overview:

Plugin intelligently analyzes and repairs vocal recordings with issues such as pitch problems, timing errors, distortion, background noise, and unwanted artifacts.
AI-driven restoration: automatic pitch correction, timing alignment, de-essing, de-noising, de-clicking, and spectral repair.
Option to preserve the natural character and emotion of the original performance.
Intuitive photorealistic UI matching the Titan7 DAW, with visual waveform analysis and repair history.
Presets and custom settings for different genres and vocal styles (pop, rap, jazz, opera, etc.).
Seamless integration with DAWâ€™s vocal processing and track management.
Stretch Features:

Automatic multi-take alignment and comping.
Batch repair for multiple vocal tracks.
Real-time audition and A/B comparison.
Export repaired vocal stems for collaboration and licensing.
The plugin should be ready for both DAW software and future hardware integration.
